### Who am I

My name is Henry Fernandes Passagem. I am a currently a Reseach and Development Scientist at LSPR in Switzerland. My work covers mainly the development of micro-optics devices and nanofabrication on chip.

<br />

Before I moved to my current position, I was a Post Doctorate in the Department of Physics at ETH Zürich. I also graduated with a degree in Physics from University of São Paulo in Brazil.
