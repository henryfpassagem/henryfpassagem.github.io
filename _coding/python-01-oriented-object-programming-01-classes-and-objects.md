### Classes

A **class** is the first concept. It is used to define something generic. In object-oriented programming, every class aims to accurately model the representation of a real-world entity. An example of a class is the Blender concept. There are many blenders in the world, of various makes and models, with various functionalities, but they all have something in common.

### Objects

I have a blender at home. You may have one too, they are both blenders, but mine is different from yours. In fact, even though they look the same (same brand, model, color, ...), they are not the same blender. This means they are different objects of the same class. An **object** (or instance of a class) is something specific.

### Attributes and Properties

In the context of a class or object, attributes are variables. A class defines attributes and an object values them.

Example:
<br><br>
A blender has a color and a power. The class `Blender` declares these attributes, but does not define their values. This means every blender has properties: color and power.
<br><br>
In short words: a class defines attributes and objects value them.

### Methods

A class, in addition to defining an object's attributes, also defines its methods (or behaviors). Methods are actions an object or class can perform. In the context of a class or object, methods are functions. A class usually defines methods, and objects call them (but in some cases, methods can be called from within the class) and methods can manipulate attributes.

Example:

- Elevator Class:
  - go up
  - go down
  - open the door
  - close the door
