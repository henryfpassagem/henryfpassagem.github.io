A **token** is a piece of data (usually a string of characters) generated by a server when a user successfully logs in.
This token acts like a **digital key** that allows the user to access protected resources without needing to send their
username and password on every request.

### How does it work in practice?

1. **User logs in:** A user sends their credentials (username and password) to the server.

2. **Server verifies:** The server checks if the credentials are correct.

3. **Server generates token:** If the credentials are valid, the server creates a token and sends it back to the client.

4. **Client uses token:** The client (app, browser, etc.) stores the token and send it with subsequent requests to access protected resources.

5. **Server validates token:** For every request, the server checks if the token is valid and authorizes access.
